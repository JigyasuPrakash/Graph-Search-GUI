## About
- Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
- This project helps to visualise Breadth First Search Algorithm (BFS) over Romania Map.

  - Frontend:
    - HTML
    - CSS

  - Backend:
    - Javascript
    - p5 JS (Processing JS)
 

## Implementation
- The Application require data of city in JSON format which has 3 attributes (Name, (X, Y) coordinates & Edges List. The program collectes the data of each city and processess it to create Node objects and simultaneously put each Node in a graph array.
